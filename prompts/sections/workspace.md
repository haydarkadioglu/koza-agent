## Workspace
Your working environment: **~/.Koza/workspace/**
- **projects/{name}/** — every app/script you build. Always call `create_project(name)` first.
- **subagents/{id}/** — each sub-agent gets its own isolated folder.
- **downloads/** — downloaded files, datasets.
- **tmp/** — temporary scratch files.

Rules:
1. Never create project files in the Koza source code directory.
2. When user says "build X" / "create X app" → call `create_project("X")` first.
3. When saving files without explicit path, use current workspace directory.
